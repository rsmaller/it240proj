                        <p class="drop-cap"> As a passionate IT student, my ethical background is very diverse. There are a lot of different factors which affect my global perspective and work ethic.
                        </p>
                        <p> My IT career started when I was a curious high schooler, for example. There are lots of things a high schooler might be curious 
                            about doing with technology and server equipment, even if it is not the best idea. I learned this lesson very quickly when I 
                            attended <a class="link" href="https://www.bluehills.org/" target="_blank">Blue Hills Regional Technical School's</a> 
                            <a class="link" href="https://www.bluehills.org/tech-programs/computer-information-systems" target="_blank">Computer Information Systems</a> program.
                        </p>
                        <p> IT professionals hold a lot of power; a few clicks can result in an entire domain controller going offline and, as a result, 
                            an entire domain crumbling to pieces. While network  redundancy can of course remediate this issue, it does not change the fact 
                            that IT is a delicate field where the professionals a lot of of trust to do their work.
                        </p>
                        <p> While I was fortuante to have learned my lesson early, I understand not everyone is in that position. Therefore, hiring for an IT
                            position is very stressful. There are so many nightmarish stories of IT professionals being upset with their employment and lashing
                            out by causing severe damage to IT infrastructure. In short, it is imperative to me that I show I am trustworthy.

                        <p>Bad things happen when ethical guidelines are not followed. In the above video, Stack Overflow did unethical things with their users' data.</p>

                <div id="beliefs" class="scrollable">
                    <p class="drop-cap"> One's work ethic and my moral compass can be nuanced, so I wanted to dedicate this section to that specifically. Firstly, I believe 
                        there are many different ways to solve a problem. For example, one way to set up an IP addressing scheme is to configure a DHCP, or 
                        Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, server. Another way to do the same thing is to set up static addressing on a network. It is very 
                        common to have some devices configure their IP addresses via DHCP and have others get static addresses. While there are multiple ways to
                        solve problems effectively, there are just as many, if not more, ways to solve a problem incorrectly. A bad solution might come up due to
                        a lack of resources, poor time management, or sometimes simply laziness. Taking shortcuts and solving a problem incorrectly is inherently
                        unethical; it can have severe negative consequences for end users. 
                    </p>
                    <p> An incorrect solution for an IP addressing scheme is to have all devices 
                        permanently use something like APIPA, or Automatic Private IP Addressing. APIPA is meant to be used as an emergency backup in the absence of
                        a real DHCP server. It works by having devices peer-to-peer negotiate their IP addresses. The addressing scheme always begins with 169.254.
                        This solution is fast to implement, mainly because on Windows machines this can be done by doing literally nothing, but it will only work
                        for a short period of time, especially on larger networks. Internet routability is also completely broken when using APIPA.
                    </p>
                    <p> In the problem solving process, one must prioritize fixing the problem to the fullest extent, considering other factors like budget and time 
                        availability within reason. Unrelated personal issues or conflicts of interest, like not wanting to implement a solution because it is tedious, 
                        should not influence a problem's solution. IT professionals must follow this guideline to do their jobs ethically and effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p> For an example I can give, at some point in my college career, I started working at Target on the weekends to help me get through it. I worked 
                        night shifts, where we closed the registers when the store closed. Closing the registers involves handling a lot of money. Handling a lot of 
                        money means there are many opportunities to steal, so only highly trusted people are allowed to close the registers. Closing the registers is a 
                        sort of problem that must be solved, and the solution is to put the money in the sections where they belong. The solution is 
                        <span class="italic">not</span> to put the money in my pocket. I have a perfectly clean record in every place where I have been granted trust,
                        and I plan on keeping it that way.

                        <a class="link" href="https://the-sysadmin-book.com/" target="_blank"><span class="italic">The Practice of System and Network Administration</span> &ndash; Third Edition</a> 
                        by Thomas Limoncelli, Christina Hoagan, and Strata Chalup. This book has a lot of different sections on handling different situations effectively, like 
                        how to negotiate effectively with people whom one wants to keep a good relationship with, how to help angry or confrontational clients, or the right 
                        things to do around auditors and law enforcement.
                    </p>
                    <p> Interestingly, <span class="italic">The Practice of System and Network Administration</span> is not designed to be just an ethical guideline. It has many 
                        sections detailing how to be an effective, helpful, and ethical IT professional, and I would strongly recommend the book to anyone looking for more 
                        information on the practice of IT and even more so for system administration.</p>
