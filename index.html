                        <h4>My Story</h4>
                        <p class="drop-cap"> My journey as an IT student started when I was roughly 8 years old. I had an ancient Toshiba laptop running <span class="italic">Windows Vista SP1</span>,
                            if anyone remembers that mess of an operating system. So, my first experience installing software and tinkering with the various menus and buttons Windows 
                            machines have was largely extended. I might have tried playing a game like Minecraft on my computer, and there would be issues with the installation.
                            As frustrating as that was, I learned how to retrace my steps and understand where things went wrong.
                        </p>
                        <p> From that point onward, my passion for computing silently grew. In middle school, I would sometimes take apart different pieces of hardware I had laying 
                            around to see how they worked. These pieces of hardware would often be things like electronic toys, broken hard disks, old laptops and desktops, and so on.
                        </p>
                        <p> High school is where my passion truly blossomed. I went to a vocational school called <a class="link" href="https://www.bluehills.org/" target="_blank">Blue Hills Regional Technical School</a>. 
                            The fun began when I got into the <a href="https://www.bluehills.org/tech-programs/computer-information-systems" target="_blank" class="link">Computer Information Systems</a> vocation. 
                            I learned all the different components and connectors on a computer.
                        </p>
                        <p> My next journey was computer networking. I created complex simulated Cisco network environments in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netacad.com/cisco-packet-tracer" class="link">Packet Tracer</a>, 
                            and I competed in a <a href="https://www.skillsusa.org/competitions/skillsusa-championships/categories-and-descriptions/" class="link" target="_blank">SkillsUSA</a> event about 
                            Cisco networking. One of the concepts that has stuck with me over time is subnetting, the process of dividing networks into smaller networks to suit the needs
                            of an organization. It involves a lot of binary math, so it might be confusing to anyone unfamiliar with binary, but it is something I am very passionate about.
                        </p>
                        <p> I then learned about virtual machines and the UNIX/Linux command line. I use bash on a day-to-day basis for my IT work, and I am extremely grateful to have
                            been familiarized with it. Files can be created, modified, moved around, and removed with extreme precision and efficiency, and automated tasks can be performed
                            quickly without having to navigate user-hostile graphical environments. 
                        </p>
                        <p> And finally, my most recent project has been software development. Combining what I know about subnetting, computer hardware, and command-line environments,
                            I created something I am extremely proud of: command-line and graphical applications for calculating different subnets. For anyone curious, the source code for
                            these applications can be found in my <a class="link" target="_self" href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>.

                                <p class="drop-cap"> I am an Information Technology student at the University of Massachusetts Boston with a concentration in System Administration. My study is within the
                                    College of Science and Mathematics.
                                </p>
                                <p> Over the years, I grew fond of anything relating to computing, whether that be hardware, software, programming, network infrastructure, 
                                    engineering, or anything between.
                                </p>
                                <p> I do not plan on stopping there, though. I am eager to learn and continue my career in the path of IT and Computer Science!</p>
